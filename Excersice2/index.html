            <hr> I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU">video of my last lecture</a>, which was not about computer science.
            <hr> Khan Academy now carries <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">algorithms tutorials</a> for which <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~devin">Devin Balkcom</a> and I produced content.
            <hr> Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>?
            <p>
                If you are, then see the <a href="#solutions">frequently asked question and answer</a> below.
                <p>
                    If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.
                    <hr> From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <a href="https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric</a>.
                    <p>
                        I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a <a href="Cormen-rules.pdf">list of usage rules</a> that I required my students to observe.
                    <hr> In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a <a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-06-15/women-computer-science-little-mentoring-goes-long-way">story on mentoring women in computer science</a> in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.
